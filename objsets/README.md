# Data and Abstraction

## Class Heirarchies

+ Abstract classes can contain members which are missing an definition while non abstract classes cannot
+ Persistent data structures: When we make changes to a data structure such as a binary tree, we don't mutate it. We simply add another tree in parallel to the one that already existed with the additional data that we wanted to add. Thus the original tree stays put or *persists*.
+ Scala Classes: any user-defined class extends another class. 
  
  +If no superclass is given, the standard class ```Object``` in the Java package ```java.lang``` is assumed.
  + the direct or indirect superclasses of a class C are called *base classes*
